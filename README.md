**Telecom Churn Case Study: Logistic Regression**

**Problem Statement:**

In this project, we aim to predict whether a particular customer will switch to another telecom provider or not, a process referred to as churning and not churning in telecom terminology.

**Objectives:**

- Predict Churn: Develop a logistic regression model using 21 predictor variables to predict customer churn.
- Identify Key Factors: Determine the variables that significantly influence a customer's decision to churn.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the logistic regression model to ensure its accuracy and reliability in predicting customer churn.

**Dataset:**

The dataset includes 21 predictor variables related to customer demographics, usage patterns, and other relevant factors, along with the target variable indicating whether the customer churned or not.

**Key Components:**

Code: Scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and model building.
Data: The dataset used for the analysis.
Documentation: Detailed explanation of the steps
